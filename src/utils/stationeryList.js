They need 24 hours to dry, and can be dried in open air, no heat required. They are most effective on white and light fabric and will lose their effect on dark fabric. If you want to paint your denims, just make sure they are light denim. Colours may bleed together if painted on too quickly. Allow each colour to dry for a few minutes before overlapping. Go crazy and transform your wardrobe with your own custom designs and rest assured that they can be washed over and over again",
